# CSHelper
This is CSHelper; a personal project I created to help CS Majors in general. To run this program locally, run "npm run build" in order to download the necessary packages and then 
run "npm run dev" in the frontend and backend. 
You are going to have to create your own .env file with the necessary api keys in order for this website to run correctly.


for the .env file follow this template:

MONGODB_URI=

appName=
PORT = 

JWT_SECRET = 

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = 

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = 

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = 


NODE_ENV = development


OPENAI_API_KEY=
